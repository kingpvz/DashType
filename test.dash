;Welcome to DashType!
;This is a sample program to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle.
;Let's first define a and b - our legs of a right triangle.
a<<4
b<<7

;A simple calculation to get the hypotenuse.
c<<(a^2+b^2)^(1/2)

;Let's output A=4 A^2=16
<<?A=
<<a
<<? A^2=
<<a^2;
;We use semicolons in expressions to create a new line.

;Let's output B=7 B^2=49
<<?B=
<<b
<<? B^2=
<<b^2;

;Let's output the formula.
<<?C^2 = (A^2+B^2)
<<;
;Using semicolons in strings (starting with ?) will result in the being printed as, well, semicolons. So we added another output that will print an empty expression with a new line character.

;Let's output C^2=65 (due to float problems, it will actually output something like 64.9999999999)
<<?C^2=
<<c^2;
<<;
;An empty line.

;Let's output the value of c.
<<?C=
<<c
